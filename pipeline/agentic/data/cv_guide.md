## ATS Rules (clean parsing)

- Single-column layout (no sidebars, no parallel columns)
- Standard headers: "Professional Summary", "Work Experience", "Education", "Skills", "Certifications", "Projects"
- Optional sections (Core Competencies, Work Experience, Projects, Education, Certifications, Awards & Honors, Skills) are dropped entirely — header included — when their array is empty or absent
- No text in images/SVGs
- No critical info in PDF headers/footers (ATS ignores them)
- UTF-8, selectable text (not rasterized)
- No nested tables
- Distributed JD keywords: Summary (top 5), first bullet of each role, Skills section
- No hidden text, keyword stuffing, or white-font tricks. Optimize for parseability plus human review.

**Optional parseability check:** after generating the HTML you can score it for ATS-friendliness with `node verify-ats.mjs output/cv-{candidate}-{company}.html` (see `modes/ats.md`). This is deterministic, read-only, and advisory — it reports a 0-100 score plus concrete issues but never blocks generation (unlike the `verify-cv-facts.mjs` fact gate in Step 18).

## Recruiter Review Gates

- The summary should answer: "What role is this person targeting, and why this one?"
- The first screen should show 1-2 proof points that map to the JD's highest-risk requirements.
- Bullets should emphasize outcomes, systems, users, or business effects rather than task history.
- Logistics such as location, work authorization, salary, and availability belong in the CV only when appropriate for the market and profile; otherwise handle them in form answers or recruiter scripts.

## Section order (optimized "6-second recruiter scan")

1. Header (large name, gradient, contact, portfolio link)
2. Professional Summary (3-4 lines, keyword-dense)
3. Core Competencies (6-8 keyword phrases in flex-grid)
4. Work Experience (reverse chronological)
5. Projects (top 3-4 most relevant)
6. Education & Certifications
7. Skills (languages + technical)

## Keyword injection strategy (ethical, truth-based)

Examples of legitimate reformulation:
- JD says "RAG pipelines" and CV says "LLM workflows with retrieval" → change to "RAG pipeline design and LLM orchestration workflows"
- JD says "MLOps" and CV says "observability, evals, error handling" → change to "MLOps and observability: evals, error handling, cost monitoring"
- JD says "stakeholder management" and CV says "collaborated with team" → change to "stakeholder management across engineering, operations, and business"

**NEVER add skills that the candidate does not have. Only reword real experience using the exact JD vocabulary.**
